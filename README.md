# Personal-Webpage
Vista Ridge Personal Webpage
This is my first time making my own website using html, js, and css code.
The theme is all about showcasing my personal pictures.
Pictures were all taken by me either with a Samsung S5 mini duos and a S20+ cellphone OR a SONY DSC-F828 Cyber-shot.
Pictures are in 3 categories. Food/cooking, Scenery of my home and home projects.
This page will be private and for invited viewers only.
All images and my own and you do not have permission to copy or post elesewhere.
Projects in this website include: Sliders, Memory game, contact form, external links
